# EducationalSite-1

The project is a Educational Site web application which uses spring boot and postman to check the REST API.
The educational site uses post mapping to take input from the user such as id,name,phno..etc and then stores it in Mysql database 
we can also use get mapping to get all the details of the users stored in the database.
